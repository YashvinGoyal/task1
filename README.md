HELLO EVERYONE MY SELF YASHVIN GOYAL ,AS MY AUDIO IS NOT WORKING SO I WOULD USE WORD FOR SOME EXPLANATION
LETS START 
WITH NORMAL CASE WHEN NEW USER COME ,FIRSTLY LOGIN PAGE WILL APPEAR AS NEW USER HE WOULD FIRST SIGNUP BY CLICKING ON NOT A MEMBER
HE WOLUD BE DIRECTED TO SIGNUP PAGE FOR FILLING THE DETAILS,AFTER FILLING THE CORRECT DETAILS HE WOULD BE DIRECTED TO LOGIN PAGE
AFTER FILLING THE CORRECT CREDENTIALS HE WOULD BE DIRECTED TO DASHBOARD BASED ON FILLIED ROLE {DOCTOR,PATIENT} AND THEN BY CLICKING ON LOGOUT HE WOULD BE DIRECTED BACK TO LOGIN PAGE. Till this we have done

NOW CONSIDER IF HE ENTER THE WRONG LOGIN DETIALS THEN HE WOULD BE shown error. Now I will enter wrong password 
NOW CONSIDER DURING SIGNUP HE ENTER THE PASSWORD AND CONFIRM PASSWORD WRONG SO HE WILL SHOWN ERROR . that is they donâ€™t match !!
ThanKYou!!!
